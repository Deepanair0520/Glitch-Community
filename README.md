Getting Started
-----------------

- the app starts at `server.coffee`
- `client.coffee` is compiled and served as /client.js
- view templates start at `templates/hello.jadelet`
- stylus files like `public/style.styl` is compiled and served directly as `public/style.css`
- Files in `public/` are served directly
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
