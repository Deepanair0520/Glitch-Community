Jadelet Base
=================

Databinding, client app framework, lets you code a client-side application with the conventions of a server-based node app





Jadelet is based on [Hamlet](http://hamlet.coffee). We use Jadelet to make the [Gomix editor](https://gomix.com/#!/project/jadelet-base) and the [community site](http://gomix.com/community)

-----------

- your app starts at `server.coffee`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`
- `client.coffee` is compiled and served as /client.js
- stylus files like `public/style.styl` is compiled and served directly as `public/style.css`
- Files in `public/` are served directly
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
