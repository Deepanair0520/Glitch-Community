Wish List
---------

These development tasks are on our radar for glitch.com, but are far enough out that contributions to these items are unlikely to be steamrollered by our major initiatives.

Feel free to remix this site and take a stab at some of these topics, or to simply use these bullet points as seeds for conversations and investigations.

Without further ado,  our wishlist:

- A Glitch API NPM package, likely modeled off of the [manuscript-api](https://glitch.com/~manuscript-api)
- A stronger [glitch button](glitch.com/~button) which collects project usage stats (think mini-analytics: page views, uniques, geoip), and a section on the project page to display said stats (if present) or to give button installation instructions if not
- Unit tests (built in to this project)
- Integrations tests (which monitor glitch.com and community-staging.glitch.me for updates and run when a new deploy is out.)
- extraction of 'new-stuff' js into a seperate glitch project with a simple API to power the 'new stuff' content both in this site and in the glitch editor.  Consider RSS. 
- Small, fun feature ideas for @user, @team, or ~project pages
- Contributions to our Starter Projects (see items in the 'new project' list) to help them feel more fun, welcoming, instructive, creative, etc. ...Or if you make a new one, pitch it to us and we'll consider it for the list.
- Design and content contributions to our /search page; prototypes of better/more awesome search.
