Wish List
---------

These development tasks are on our radar for glitch.com, but are far enough out that contributions to these items are unlikely to be steamrollered my our major initiatives.

Feel free to remix this site and take a stab at some of these topics, or to simply use these bullet points as seeds for conversations and investigations.

Without further ado,  our wishlist:

- A Glitch API NPM package, likely modeled off of the [manuscript-api](https://glitch.com/~manuscript-api)
- A stronger [glitch button](glitch.com/~button) which collects project usage stats (think mini-analytics: page views, uniques, geoip), and a section on the project page to display said stats (if present) or to give button installation instructions if not
- conversions of .jade files to .jsx files
- extraction of 'new-stuff'.jade/js into a seperate glitch project with a simple API to power the 'new stuff' content both in this side and in the glitch editor.  Consider RSS. 
- Small, fun feature ideas for @user, @team, or ~project pages
