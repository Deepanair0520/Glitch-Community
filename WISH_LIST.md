Wish List
---------

These development tasks are on our radar for glitch.com, but are far enough out that contributions to these items are unlikely to be steamrollered my our major initiatives.

Feel free to remix this site and take a stab at some of these topics, or to simply use these bullet points as seeds for conversations and investigations.

Without further ado,  our wishlist:

- A Glitch API NPM package, likely modeled off of the [manuscript-api](https://glitch.com/~manuscript-api)
- A stronger [glitch button](glitch.com/~button)
